# Goal
```
Build a simple calculator using ReactJs 
```
# Description

This calculator application uses React's state and event handling to perform the basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The input field is bound to the inputValue state variable, which is updated on every change event. When a user clicks on an operation button, the appropriate function is called to update the result state variable and reset the inputValue. The result is then displayed in a h2 element.
